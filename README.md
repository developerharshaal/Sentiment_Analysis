# Comparative Analysis

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook, Comparative Analysis, authored by Harshaal Bajaj (21BCE083), is a comprehensive study focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis. The goal of this analysis is to compare different machine learning models to determine their effectiveness in classifying sentiments from a given dataset. The notebook systematically guides you through the entire process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

The analysis includes the following key sections:

Importing Libraries: Initializing all the necessary Python libraries required for the analysis.
Importing the Dataset: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for further processing.
Overviewing the Dataset: Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Cleaning the Texts: Preprocessing the textual data to remove noise and prepare it for modeling.
Creating the Bag of Words Model: Transforming the textual data into numerical features using the Bag of Words approach.
Splitting the Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Implementation:
Logistic Regression: Implementing and evaluating a Logistic Regression model.
Naive Bayes: Applying the Naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Using the KNN algorithm to classify sentiments.
Random Forest: Implementing a Random Forest model to improve classification accuracy.
Multi-layer Perceptron: Exploring the effectiveness of neural networks for sentiment analysis.
Deep Learning Model: Evaluating a deep learning model for sentiment classification.
This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the performance of various machine learning models in the context of NLP and Sentiment Analysis, highlighting their strengths and limitations.
